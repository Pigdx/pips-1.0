# Anything coming after a pound sign is a comment.
# Typically there may be one or more comment lines explaining the
# subject matter of the input file.
#
# Each line in this file follows a key-value format.  The first word
# in the line gives the parameter that is being specified, and the subsequent
# words give the value of this parameter. 
#
# The PROTSEQ key specifies the sequence of the protein to be analyzed.  Typically, this
# will be a FASTA file in which the sequence of interest is the first entry, as shown below.
PROTSEQ A_Aichi_2_68_H3_HA.fasta
#
# The PDB_FILE key specifies the name of the PDB file containing the structure of the
# protein of interest.  Further information about this PDB structure is supplied
# the keys PDB_SEQS_FILE, PDB_CHAIN, and PDB_RES_MAPPING.
PDB_FILE 2HMG.pdb
#
# The PDB_SEQS_FILE key specifies the name of a FASTA file containing the sequences
# of the chains in the PDB file.  This should be a FASTA file containing one or more
# sequences.  The header for each sequence should consist ONLY of the chain identifier.
# For example, if the PDB structure has two chains, A and B, the FASTA file might be:
#     >A
#     MTRSQFV
#     >B
#     MSRWNNQF
# If the chain has no ID (which sometimes happens when there is only one chain), then
# the header should be empty, as in:
#     >
#     MTRSQFV
# It is important that PDB_SEQS_FILE lists all of the chains in the PDB file even if they
# are not all being used in the CUPSAT calculation, because the script uses this file
# to determine how many chains are in the PDB structure.
PDB_SEQS_FILE 2HMG_seqs.fasta
#
# The PDB_CHAIN key gives the chain ID of the chain that we are analyzing.  This ID
# must match that given in the header of PDB_SEQS_FILE.  If there is only one chain and
# it has no ID, then the chain ID should be set to the string NONE.
PDB_CHAIN A_concatenated_with_B
# 
# The PDB_RES_MAPPING specifies the relationship between the residue numbers in the PDB file
# and the residues in the PDB chain sequence given in PDB_SEQS_FILE.  In the simplest case,
# the residues in the chain sequence and in the PDB file exactly correspond, with the first
# residue in the chain being residue 1 in the PDB file, the second being residue 2, and
# so on.  In other words, the residues in the PDB file are numbered sequentially with
# no offset.  In this case, PDB_RES_MAPPING would have the following value:
# PDB_RES_MAPPING OFFSET 0
# It is also possible that the residues in the PDB file are numbered sequentially, but
# that there is an offset.  If the first residue in the PDB chain is numbered as X + 1 in
# the PDB file, the second residue in the PDB chain is numbered as X + 2, etc, then
# this is called an offset of X (where X is some integer).  In this case, PDB_RES_MAPPING 
# would have the following value:
# PDB_RES_MAPPING OFFSET X
# If either of these OFFSET options are used, then there must be matching residues in
# the PDB file up through the last residue of the PDB chain sequence (i.e. the PDB chain
# sequence specified in PDB_SEQS_FILE cannot contain additional C-terminal residues
# that are not present in the PDB structure file).
# Finally, there is the possibility that the residues in the PDB file are numbered 
# non-sequentially (or that we only want to look at certain residues).  In this case,
# we explicitly list the number mappings.  For example, say that the sequence of the
# chain in which we are interested is MTRSQFV.  Say that in the PDB file the first
# residue that appears is T which is numbered 4, then an R numbered 5, then an S numbered
# 7, a Q numbered 8, no F, and then a V numbered 10.  In this case, PDB_RES_MAPPING could be
# set as shown below:
# PDB_RES_MAPPING START_RESIDUE_LIST
# PDB_RES_MAPPING 2 4 A
# PDB_RES_MAPPING 3 5 A
# PDB_RES_MAPPING 4 7 A
# PDB_RES_MAPPING 5 8 A
# PDB_RES_MAPPING 7 10 A
# PDB_RES_MAPPING END_RESIDUE_LIST
# In other words, every line starts with PDB_RES_MAPPING, and each line between the 
# START_RESIDUE_LIST and END_RESIDUE_LIST keys gives the number of the residue in
# sequentially numbered sequence followed by the corresponding number in the PDB file. 
# The residue numbers are then followed by the chain ID for the residue in the 
# PDB structure, which in this case does not have to match the chain in PDB_SEQS_FILE.
# So if you wanted to analyze a protein that spans two protein sequence chains, you would
# concatenate the chains into a single sequence in PDB_SEQS_FILE, and then map them to
# the two different chains in the PDB structure using PDB_RES_MAPPING.
# Any residues that do not appear in the list are not analyzed.

#
# The ALIGNMENT_PROG key is used to specify information about a sequence alignment
# program.  This program is used to align the protein sequence specified by PROTSEQ
# with the PDB protein sequence specified by PDB_SEQS_FILE.  There should be two
# strings following the ALIGNMENT_PROG key, specifying the alignment program and a path
# to the alignment executable.  The two supported alignment programs are
# MUSCLE (http://www.drive5.com/muscle/index.htm) and PROBCONS
# (http://probcons.stanford.edu/).  This script has been tested and confirmed to work
# with version 3.6 of MUSCLE and version 1.12 of PROBCONS.  PROBCONS is the slower
# program, but in general is considered to be more accurate, so should probably be
# preferred unless there are time constraints due to the size of the alignment.
# The specified path should contain executables with the name of either 'muscle'
# or 'probcons'.  So valid entries would be:
# ALIGNMENT_PROG MUSCLE /Users/bloom/muscle3.6/
ALIGNMENT_PROG PROBCONS /Users/bloom/probcons/
#
