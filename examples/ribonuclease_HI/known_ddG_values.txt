# This file lists ddGs for mutations to E coli ribonuclease HI.  The
# exception to this is that I have excluded ddG values for mutations to active site residues or
# residues that are known to be crucially involved in function.  The reason is that these mutations
# may be thermodynamically stabilizing, but selected against by functional pressures.  The
# ddG values are for free energies of folding, so a positive ddG value indicates a destabilizing
# mutation.  All ddG values given below are in units of kcal/mol.  Each ddG value is preceded by 
# the reference from with it was taken.

#      This paper looks at several mutations to Ser 68, a buried residue in ribonuclease HI.
#      One of the mutations is markedly stabilizing.  All of the mutants have at least 40%
#      of wildtype activity, although there are drops to 40%.  The ddG values for chemical
#      denaturation at pH 5.5 are given in Table 3 in kJ/mol for unfolding; I have converted
#      them to be for folding.  Note that these values are fairly different from ones calculated
#      by thermal denaturation at pH 3.0 (Table 4).  I have converted them to kcal/mol by multiplying
#      by 0.24.

#      This paper replaces a left-handed Leu with other residues, and finds that some of the mutations
#      are stabilizing.  All of the mutants had activities comparable to wildtype.  The ddG values,
#      as determined by thermal denaturation, are given in Table I.  I have taken the values at pH 5.5;

#      I have converted them to be for folding.

#      This paper combines five stabilizing mutations, and shows that the resulting protein
#      is highly stable and still has good activity.  The ddG values for the mutations
#      (which originally come from other studies) at pH 5.5 are give in Table 1 in kcal/mol
#      for unfolding; I have converted to be for folding.
#      Note that the more stable protein is also more resistant to proteolysis. 
#      I have not included the mutations to residue D134, both because there is some possibility
#      that this residue is critical for catalysis, and also because the ddG values vary dramatically
#      from pH 3.0 to pH 5.5.
