# Anything coming after a pound sign is a comment.
# Typically there may be one or more comment lines explaining the
# subject matter of the input file.
#
# Each line in this file follows a key-value format.  The first word
# in the line gives the parameter that is being specified, and the subsequent
# words give the value of this parameter. 
#
# The PROTSEQ key specifies the sequence of the protein to be analyzed.  Typically, this
# will be a FASTA file in which the sequence of interest is the first entry, as shown below.
PROTSEQ NA_NC99.fasta
#
# The ALIGNMENT key specifies the multiple sequence alignment of the homologous proteins.
# This alignment should be given by a FASTA file.
# The first protein sequence in this alignment must match that specified by PROTSEQ, with
# the possible addition of some gap characters.  Once the alignment has been read, positions
# corresponding to gaps in this sequence are stripped away from all sequences.  In addition,
# the names of the sequences must match those contained in the phylogenetic tree specified
# by the tree parameter.  The name of a sequence is considered to consist of all characters
# from the beginning of the header until the first colon.  For example, if the sequences are
# named "SEQ1" and "SEQ2", the file might look like this:
# >SEQ1: this sequence matches that given by PROTSEQ
# MT-DYST-FFT
# >SEQ2: second sequence
# MTFEFSTN-FS
ALIGNMENT renamed_alignment.fasta
#
# The TREE key specifies the phylogenetic tree giving the evolutionary relationships of
# the sequences in the multiple sequence alignment.  Typically, this tree is specified
# in a text file in the Newick format (http://evolution.gs.washington.edu/phylip/newick_doc.html).
# Branch lengths must be specified for all branches; the tree must be rooted; the sequence
# names must match those of the multiple sequence alignment specified by ALIGNMENT; there must
# be no spaces or quotations in the sequence names.

#
# The PRIORS key specifies the centers for the prior probability distributions over the ddG
# values.  These priors themselves are beta distributions with the sum of the shape parameters
# specified by PRIORS_BETA_SUM.  If you want all of the priors to be centered at the same value,
# then simply have the value be the number of that center.  A typical value would be 5, as in:
# PRIORS 5
# which specifies regularizing priors peaked at 5.  If you want the priors to be proportional
# to the magnitude of the difference in the amino acid hydrophobicities (as determined by the 
# Kyte-Doolittle scale), then the value would be:
# PRIORS KYTE_DOOLITTLE_HYDROPHOBICITY 1 0
# where the last two numbers specify respectively a scaling factor by which the magnitude of 
# the hydrophobicity difference is multiplied, and a factor that is then added to this
# rescaled value.  Typically values would simply be 1 and 0 as shows above.
# If you want to specify a specific prior estimate for each ddG value (for example, these estimates
# might be derived from some physicochemical modeling program), then you need to specify a file
# containing these prior estimates, as in:
PRIORS REGULARIZING 5
PRIORS HYDROPHOBICITY KYTE_DOOLITTLE_HYDROPHOBICITY 1 0
#PRIORS CUPSAT FILE CUPSAT_PREDICTIONS.TXT 10 5 -5 15 5
#PRIORS FOLDX FILE FOLDX_PREDICTIONS.TXT 10 5 -5 15 5
# where the second value (ddgs_priors.txt) gives the name of the file containing the prior estimates,
# and the final value is a number specifying the prior estimate given to any ddG for which an estimate
# is not contained in the file.  The file itself should be a text file.  The first two lines can contain 
# anything (typically they are some sort of header).  The third and subsequent lines should give the 
# ddG values for each mutation as in
# M1A 5.5
# M1C 6.7
# etc.  Remember that the residues are numbered sequentially beginning with number one according
# to the protein sequence specified by PROTSEQ.
#
# PRIORS_BETA_SUM is a number > 2 specifying the sum of the beta distribution parameters.  The
# typical value is 3, as in:
PRIORS_BETA_SUM 3
#
# Larger values lead to "tighter" priors while smaller values lead to "looser" priors.
#
# The MUTPROBS key specifies how the mutation probabilities are set.  If you want it to be
# equally probable for any amino acid to mutate to any other, use the value ALL_EQUAL, as in
# MUTPROBS ALL_EQUAL
# If you want to assume that each amino acid is equally likely to be in any of its codons,
# and that these codons are equally likely to mutate to any other one-mutation neighbor codon,
# the use the value CODON_EQUAL, as in
# MUTPROBS CODON_EQUAL
# If you want to assume that each amino acid is equally likely to be in any of its codons,
# and that these codons mutate to adjacent codons according to a particular nucleotide
# transition-transversion bias, then use the value TRANSITION_TRANSVERSION_RATIO r (where r
# is the ratio), as in
MUTPROBS TRANSITION_TRANSVERSION_RATIO 4
#
# The MUTRATE key specifies the "mutation rate," which is meaningful with respect to the branch
# lengths of the phylogenetic tree.  Essentially, it gives the number of actual mutations that
# are assumed to have occurred for each unit change along the phylogenetic tree.  You might
# think of this as the number of mutations that occur before the occurrence of an evolutionarily
# "acceptable" one.  Reasonable values would probably be in the range from 5 to 20.
MUTRATE 10
#
# The NRANDOMSTARTS key specifies how many times we perform the likelihood maximization for each
# residue (we take the best value).  Typically, just one is adequate since the ddG values usually
# converge to essentially the same maximum, but you can try values larger than one just to be
# safe and increase the chances of hitting the global maximum.  Increasing the value will of course
# increase the programs runtime.
NRANDOMSTARTS 5
