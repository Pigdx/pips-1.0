Contents of input file are listed below:

********
# Anything coming after a pound sign is a comment.
# Typically there may be one or more comment lines explaining the
# subject matter of the input file.
#
# Each line in this file follows a key-value format.  The first word
# in the line gives the parameter that is being specified, and the subsequent
# words give the value of this parameter. 
#
# The PROTSEQ key specifies the sequence of the protein to be analyzed.  Typically, this
# will be a FASTA file in which the sequence of interest is the first entry, as shown below.
PROTSEQ cutinase.fasta
#
# The OUTPUT_ALIGNMENT key specifies the name of the file to which the aligned protein
# sequences are written.  This key should therefore be followed by a string giving
# a valid file name.  If the file already exists, the user will be prompted for confirmation
# before it is overwritten.  The aligned sequences are written to this file in FASTA format,
# with the first sequence in the file being the one specified by PROTSEQ.  The sequences
# are aligned by inserting gap ("-") characters as appropriate.  The sequences that are 
# aligned include PROTSEQ and all unique sequences specified by HOMOLOGOUS_SEQS
# that satisfy the criteria established by HOMOLOGY_THRESHOLD.  The headers
# of these sequences are replaced with short names, that are related to the original headers
# as described in the file specified by OUTPUT_SEQNAMES.  These names are the ones used
# in the phylogenetic tree specified by OUTPUT_TREE.
OUTPUT_ALIGNMENT renamed_alignment.fasta
#
# The OUTPUT_TREE key specifies the name of the file to which is written the phylogenetic
# tree specifying the relationship among the sequences in OUTPUT_ALIGNMENT.  The names
# of the sequences in this tree match those used in OUTPUT_ALIGNMENT, and are detailed in
# relation to the original seauence headers by OUTPUT_SEQNAMES.  The tree is
# in Newick format (http://evolution.gs.washington.edu/phylip/newick_doc.html).  If the
# specified file already exists, the user is prompted for confirmation before the file
# is overwritten.
OUTPUT_TREE tree.newick
#
# The OUTPUT_SEQNAMES key specifies the name of a file to which we write the relationship
# between the new names given to the sequences in OUTPUT_TREE and OUTPUT_ALIGNMENT, and
# the original sequence names as given in their headers in the FASTA files specified by
# PROTSEQ and HOMOLOGOUS_SEQS.  The format is simply lines with the new name, a space,
# and then the original header in the FASTA file. 
OUTPUT_SEQNAMES seqnames.txt
#
# The PHYLIP_PROG key is used to specify information about the PHYLIP program that is
# used to generate the phylogenetic tree.  This PIPS script is guaranteed to work with 
# version 3.68 of PHYLIP for Mac OS X, downloaded from 
# http://evolution.genetics.washington.edu/phylip.html
# It will probably also work with other versions of PHYLIP on other operating
# systems, but that has not been actually tested.  There are a number of 
# strings that are present after the PHYLIP_PROG key.  These strings cannot
# contain spaces, but can have any other non-whitespace characters.  They are:
#  * The first string should give the path to which the PHYLIP executables can
#    be found. 
#  * The second string is the type of tree that is build.  Currently, the only
#    supported option is DISTANCE for methods based on pairwise distances
#    between sequences.  These trees are built using one of the 'fitch',
#    'kitsch', or 'neighbor' programs of PHYLIP.
#  * The third string specifies whether or not we are using a molecular clock.
#    It can have two values, CLOCK or NO_CLOCK depending on whether or not
#    we assume a molecular clock.  If we are not using a molecular clock,
#    then the OUTGROUP_SEQ key must be set to a value in order to provide
#    an outgroup sequence for rooting the tree.
#  * The fourth string specifies whether or not we use a neighbor joining
#    method (neighbor joining without a molecular clock, or UPGMA with
#    a molecular clock).  Neighbor joining is generally faster, but
#    considered to be less accurate.  The string should be either
#    NEIGHBOR if we are using neighbor joining / UPGMA or NO_NEIGHBOR
#    if we are not.  Neighbor joining can lead to negative branch lengths,
#    so any negative lengths are set to zero.
PHYLIP_PROG /Users/bloom/phylip-3.68/exe/ DISTANCE CLOCK NO_NEIGHBOR
#
# The ALIGNMENT_PROG key is used to specify information about the program used to make
# the multiple sequence alignment of the protein sequences.  There should be two 
# strings following the ALIGNMENT_PROG key, specifying the alignment program and a path
# to the alignment executable.  The two supported alignment programs are
# MUSCLE (http://www.drive5.com/muscle/index.htm) and PROBCONS
# (http://probcons.stanford.edu/).  This script has been tested and confirmed to work
# with version 3.6 of MUSCLE and version 1.12 of PROBCONS.  PROBCONS is the slower
# program, but in general is considered to be more accurate, so should probably be
# preferred unless there are time constraints due to the size of the alignment.
# The specified path should contain executables with the name of either 'muscle'
# or 'probcons'.  So valid entries would be:
# ALIGNMENT_PROG MUSCLE /Users/bloom/muscle3.6/
ALIGNMENT_PROG PROBCONS /Users/bloom/probcons/
#
# The HOMOLOGOUS_SEQS key specifies the homologous sequences that are aligned
# and used to build the phylogenetic tree.  The key should be followed by the
# names of one or more existing FASTA files.  All of these sequences are read.
# Any duplicate sequences (identical sequences, NOT necessarily identical headers)
# have only the first sequence retained, with subsequent duplicates discarded.  These
# sequences are then screened according to the criteria specified by HOMOLOGY_THRESHOLD,
# and any sufficiently homologous sequences are retained for the alignment and to 
# build the phylogenetic tree.  For the alignment, the sequences are renamed
# as specified by OUTPUT_SEQNAMES
HOMOLOGOUS_SEQS cutinase-refseq-blast.fasta
#
# The HOMOLOGY_THRESHOLD key specifies the screening of the sequences in HOMOLOGOUS_SEQS.
# It can be used to only include sequences that have a specified degree of identity with
# PROTSEQ.  You should specify both an identity cutoff and a gap cutoff.  The identity
# cutoff, which occurs after the string IDENTITY_CUTOFF, means that we only include
# sequences in which the fractions of identities among alignable residues is greater than
# or equal to this cutoff.  The gap cutoff, which comes after the string GAP_CUTOFF,
# means that we only include sequences in which the fraction of graps is less 
# than or equal to the indicated cutoff.  These values are computed
# in pairwise alignments of PROTSEQ with each sequence.  For example, if the sequence
# specified by PROTSEQ is MGCQT and the pairwise aligned homologous sequence is MG-QA,
# then the identity is 0.75 and the gap fraction is 0.2.  If you don't want to exclude any
# of the sequences, then set the identity cutoff to 0.0 and the gap cutoff 1.0, which
# will include all sequences.
HOMOLOGY_THRESHOLD IDENTITY_CUTOFF 0.45 GAP_CUTOFF 0.5
#
# The OUTGROUP_SEQ key specifies an outgroup sequence used to root the phylogenetic
# tree if the tree is being computed without a molecular clock.  If the tree is being
# computed without a molecular clock, then we need an outgroup to root the tree.  In general,
# the outgroup will be more distantly related to the homologous sequences.  In this case,
# the value should be the name of a FASTA file.  The first sequence listed in this
# FASTA file is used as the outgroup sequence.  So for example, this line would look like this:
# OUTGROUP_SEQ outgroup.fasta
# On the other hand, if we are not using a molecular clock, not outgroup sequence is 
# needed to root the tree.  In that case, the value should be NONE, as in:
OUTGROUP_SEQ NONE

After screening for sequences satisfying HOMOLOGY_THRESHOLD, 30 unique homologous sequences remain.

We will now build a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) of all of the relevant sequences.
The first sequence in the MSA will be PROTSEQ.
The MSA will then include the 30 screened unique homologous sequences.
This MSA will not include an outgroup sequence, since OUTGROUP_SEQ was set to NONE, and since no outgroup is needed since we are not using a molecular clock.
The MSA will include a total of 31 sequences.  These sequences have all been given short names that are acceptable to PHYLIP.  A table relating these new names to the original sequence headers has been written to the OUTPUT_SEQNAMES file of seqnames.txt.

Here are the contents of the OUTPUT_SEQNAMES file of seqnames.txt:
