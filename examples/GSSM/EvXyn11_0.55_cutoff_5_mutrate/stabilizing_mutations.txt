# This file lists the stabilizing mutations from:
#   "Engineering hyperthermostability into a GH11 xylanase is mediated by subtle changes
#   to protein structure." C Dumon et al, J Biol Chem, 283:22557-22564 (2008).
#
# These mutations were isolated by gene site saturation mutagenesis, and are for
# sequential numbering of the EvXyn11 (the catalytic domain of the full protein)
# beginning with 1 at the N-terminal Asn (NAQTL...).  These are the 15 most stabilizing mutations,
# as listed on page 22560.
