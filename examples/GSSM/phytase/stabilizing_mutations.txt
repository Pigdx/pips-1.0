# This file gives the stabilizing mutations described in:
#   "Enhancing the thermal tolerance and gastric performance of a microbial phytase for
#   use as a phosphate-mobilizing monogastric-feed supplement." Applied and Environmental
#   Microbiology. 70:3041-3046 (2004).
#
# The paper describes that overall gene site saturation mutagenesis was used to 
# discover 14 improved mutants.  These mutants were combined iteratively in a
# steepest-ascent walk type optimization to create an 8 mutant (Phy9X).  Unfortunately,
# the paper only gives the identities of the 8 mutations in that 8-mutant, so those are what
# are listed here.  
#
# The mutations are taken from Figure 1.  The numbers used correspond to sequential
# numbering of the phytase sequence beginning with 1 at the N-terminal Met.
