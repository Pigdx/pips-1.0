# This file lists the stabilizing mutations described in:
#   "Discovery of pectin-degrading enzymes and directed evolution of a novel pectate
#   lyase for processing cotton fabric." AI Solbak, et al. Journal of Biological Chemistry,
#   280:9431-9438 (2005)
#
# The paper reports finding 36 stabilizing mutations, 12 of which performed better than
# wildtype.  UNFORTUNATELY, I AM ENTIRELY UNABLE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT SORT OF NUMBERING
# SCHEME IS USED TO DESCRIBE THESE MUTATIONS, SINCE THE APPARENT SEQUENCE OF THE PECTATE
# LYASE RETURNED BY GENBANK BD9904 DOES NOT HAVE AMINO ACID MUTATIONS IN ANY SEQUENTIAL
# NUMBERING SCHEME THAT CORRESPOND TO THE RESIDUE NUMBERS FOR THE MUTATIONS.
