# Anything coming after a pound sign is a comment.
# Typically there may be one or more comment lines explaining the
# subject matter of the input file.
#
# Each line in this file follows a key-value format.  The first word
# in the line gives the parameter that is being specified, and the subsequent
# words give the value of this parameter. 
#
# The PROTSEQ key specifies the sequence of the protein to be analyzed.  Typically, this
# will be a FASTA file in which the sequence of interest is the first entry, as shown below.
PROTSEQ thioredoxin.fasta
#
# The SELECTED_MUTATION key specifies a selected mutation with a known ddG value
# These mutations are indicated in the standard form (i.e. M2A for mutation of residue 2
# from Met to Ala).  The numbers for these mutations are based on sequential numbering
# starting with one for the first residue of PROTSEQ.  The mutations are followed by
# a numbering giving the ddG value.  One or more mutations can be
# specified by listing the key repeatedly with a single mutation following, as in:
#  SELECTED_MUTATION M2A -0.3
#  SELECTED_MUTATION F25I 5.7
# Alternatively, these mutations can be listed in a file.  In this case, each line of the file
# should list a separate mutation and associated ddG in the form "M2A -0.3", etc.  
# Lines of the file that begin with #
# and anything after a # character are considered to be comments, and are ignored.  Values
# from a file are specified by using the second key FILE and then the file name, as in:
SELECTED_MUTATION FILE known_ddG_values.txt
#
# The PREDICTION_FILE key specifies the names of one or more files containing the
# ddG predictions that we wish to gather for the selected mutations.  These files should
# be of the format that is output by PIPS_ANALYSIS.PY.  Each key should specify a string
# (no spaces) giving the name of the prediction method, plus the name of the prediction file.
# Spaces in the name of the prediction file should be represented as underscores; these are
# subsequently changed to spaces in the output.
