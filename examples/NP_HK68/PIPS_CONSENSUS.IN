# Anything coming after a pound sign is a comment.
# Typically there may be one or more comment lines explaining the
# subject matter of the input file.
#
# Each line in this file follows a key-value format.  The first word
# in the line gives the parameter that is being specified, and the subsequent
# words give the value of this parameter. 
#
# The PROTSEQ key specifies the sequence of the protein to be analyzed.  Typically, this
# will be a FASTA file in which the sequence of interest is the first entry, as shown below.
PROTSEQ NP_HK68_protein.fasta
#
# The PSEUDOCOUNTS key specifies the number of pseudocounts that are added to each amino
# acid.  This should be an integer >= 0.  Note that if it set to zero, some ddG values
# will be undefined.
PSEUDOCOUNTS 1
#
# The ALIGNMENT key specifies the multiple sequence alignment of the homologous proteins.
# This alignment should be given by a FASTA file.
# The first protein sequence in this alignment must match that specified by PROTSEQ, with
# the possible addition of some gap characters.  Once the alignment has been read, positions
# corresponding to gaps in this sequence are stripped away from all sequences.  
# For example, if the sequences are
# named "SEQ1" and "SEQ2", the file might look like this:
#   >SEQ1: this sequence matches that given by PROTSEQ
#   MT-DYST-FFT
#   >SEQ2: second sequence
#   MTFEFSTN-FS
